/**
  DISCLAIMER: I am aware that TASK 2 and TASK 3 are incomplete. My experience and exposure to animation on iOS is very basic and most of the time by only using built-in objects instead of customized handlers.  I understand and can follow through overriding and handling UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate, but am not comfortable experimenting with imitating the App Store's magnifying animations presented on the task videos.  For this reason, I am performing simple animations instead just to exemplify where the core steps happen.  Nevertheless, with a bit more research and time, I would be able to complete both tasks with any major difficulty.
